# Heuristic-Optimization-Algorithms

Study on Heuristic Optimization Algorithms and the need for these algorithms to solve non-convex optimization problems, done as a group project for the course Convex Optimization, AI2101 instructed by Dr Aditya Siripuram at Indian Institute of technology, Hyderabad.

## What are Heuristic Algorithms?

A heuristic algorithm is a method for finding near-optimal solutions to a problem of optimization for which there is no exact answer or whose formulation is unknown, or if it is computationally
intensive.However, the trade-off is in terms of optimality (or) correctness in favour of speed.

Our study discusses three Heuristic algorithms the famous Travelling salesmen problem using simulated Annealing, Tabu search Heuristic on SMTWTP and Knapsack problem using Ant colony optimization.

Details of each algorithms can be found in Presentation and Report.
